    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the official ASR webpage! The Axos Socialist Republic is a Minecraft empire based on the server REDACTED.
        Founded on June 15th 2025 by Lordos Axos, or AxoFX. The capital of the ASR is Axford, one of the largest cities on the server.
        Well known for being far more advanced than its counterparts in organization, innovation, and leadership.

    <h2>Ranking</h2>

    <p>
        The ASR has a complex ranking system based around legions further broken down into divisions. At the very top are the
        <strong>Lord, Admiral, and Alligant General</strong>; together they lead the ASR to a brighter, socialist future.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below them are the <strong>Militant Director</strong> and the <strong>Civil Director</strong>, who use scientific research to benefit the public and the military.
        Then there are the <strong>Generals</strong> — three in total — each leading a legion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Generals lead the <strong>Commanders</strong>; there are three of them in each legion. Each Commander leads a division:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Ground Force</li>
        <li>Air Force</li>
        <li>Sea Force</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Within the divisions are <strong>Soldiers</strong>, trained in combat and environmental skills based on their division.
        Finally, below Commanders and equal to Soldiers are <strong>Civilians</strong> — unranked individuals who form the backbone of the ASR.

    <h2>Prefecture</h2>
    <p>
        The ASR consists of Prefectures, smaller areas or districts of the greater empire. The main Prefecture is
        <strong>Axfordshire</strong>, surrounding Axford. Each Prefecture generally has its own sub‑capital, but all are administered directly from Axford.
    </p>
    <p>
        Connecting the Prefectures are four classes of roads, canals, railways, and telegraphs. Road classes are indicated by a coloured stripe:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Red</strong> — Small, 2 lanes</li>
        <li><strong>Orange</strong> — Large, 4 lanes</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow</strong> — Speedway, 2 ice tracks</li>
        <li><strong>Unclassed</strong> — Rare, usually 2 lanes, no stripe</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Media</h2>
    <p>
        The ASR has many forms of media, such as documents, spreadsheets, images, and videos. Most of these have copyright
        protection, so please do not violate it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Classified documents will be marked with <strong>“CLASSIFIED”</strong> and list the minimum rank required to read them.
