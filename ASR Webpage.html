      We are the Axos Socialist Republic, a Minecraft empire based on the server REDACTED. Founded on the 15th of June 2025 by Lordos Axos, or AxoFX. The capital of the ASR is Axford, a large well-known city at the center of all the ASR maps.
    </p>

    <h2>Ranking</h2>
    <p>
      The ASR has a unique ranking system based around various legions broken into further divisions, all ordered top-down from the Upper Command, the truly highest-ranking members of the ASR. Below is a diagram of the current full system, including special forces.
    </p>

    <h2>Prefecture</h2>
    <p>
      Within the ASR’s borders are smaller divisions known as Prefectures, the main being Axfordshire, obviously surrounding Axford. Each prefecture contains its own sub-capital and possibly more settlements. Provinces are like prefectures but are detached from the rest of the ASR.
